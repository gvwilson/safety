<h1>Personal Safety</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Taken directly from <a href="../bibliography/#Smalls2021">Smalls2021</a>; will need rewriting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers studying everything from sexual health to COVID-19 to gun violence
are increasingly likely to be targeted because of their work.
While research institutions have rules and guidelines for safeguarding sensitive information,
these usually do not address the problem of keeping <em>individuals</em> safe
from either targeted attacks like Climategate [<a href="../bibliography/#Nature2010">Nature2010</a>]
or the kinds of drive-by threats that everyone now faces regardless of their occupation.</p>
<p>Hollywood depictions of everyday threats are as far from reality as their portrayals of scientists,
but more realistic guidance for personal digital security is freely available
[<a href="../bibliography/#FLD2020">FLD2020</a>,<a href="../bibliography/#EFJ2015">EFJ2015</a>,<a href="../bibliography/#EFF2020">EFF2020</a>].
The tips we present are a starting point:
they were written with researchers in mind,
but apply to everyone.
They do not guarantee complete safety,
any more than seatbelts guarantee safe driving,
but following them greatly reduces the likelihood of harm.</p>
<p>After discussing personal safety,</p>
<h2>Put On Your Own Mask</h2>
<p>The first and most important rule is that we should not rely on
companies, universities, and other institutions to protect us, for the
simple reason that they are not penalized if they don't. As recently as
ten years ago we could blame the lack of meaningful institutional
liability for data breaches on the law being slow to catch up with
rapidly-changing technology. Accountability for these breaches is
practically non-existent: data breaches have minimal impact on
companies' profitability and individuals are almost never fined, much
less jailed.</p>
<p>Much of what institutions force us to go through is <a href="../glossary/#security-theater">security
theater</a> intended to make us believe something is
being done rather than to actually make us safer. Requiring people to
take off their shoes at airports is one example; random searches of
backpacks and bags at the entrance to the subway is another, since
it's hard to imagine that a would-be attacker <em>wouldn't</em> just go to
another entrance. ([<a href="../bibliography/#Schneier2020">Schneier2020</a>] has many examples
of security theater and the harm it does.)</p>
<p>Security theater is counter-productive because it encourages us to cut
corners in ways that actually make us <em>less</em> safe. For example, forcing
people to change passwords every three months encourages people to
choose memorable (and therefore easy-to-guess) passwords.</p>
<h2>Digital Security is Rarely the Weakest Link</h2>
<p>The second rule is to remember that most attacks take place offline, and
that the most effective ones are often the simplest. At an airport
several years ago, one author heard a professor of computer science try
to reset an online account over the phone. In just a couple of minutes,
they had inadvertently told everyone in the lounge their full name,
their date of birth, the three-digit verification code on the back of
their credit card, and what was almost certainly their mother's maiden
name.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that safety comes from good habits, not
technology. <a href="../glossary/#social-engineering">Social engineering</a> is far more
common than hacking: in practice it is far easier to trick someone
into giving you their password than to break into their devices
digitally.</p>
<p>The key practice is <a href="../glossary/#situational-awareness">situational awareness</a>,
which is a fancy way of saying, "Pay attention to what's happening and
respond accordingly." If you start working on a high-profile subject
that will likely attract controversy you should take more precautions
than usual. For example, someone should recognize that agreeing to be
an expert witness increases the odds that they will be targeted, and
should be more careful about what he puts into email while preparing
and delivering his testimony.</p>
<p>The corollary to situational awareness is to de-escalate when you can.
Being on guard all the time is exhausting and leads to
<a href="../glossary/#security-fatigue">security fatigue</a> [<a href="../bibliography/#Stanton2016">Stanton2016</a>].
If you are too tired to follow good practices, knowing them does you
no good.</p>
<p>Two technologies that are useful, but only to a certain extent, are
Virtual Private Networks and a specialized web browser called Tor. A
Virtual Private Network (VPN) connects your device to a server, then has
the server make connections to other machines on your behalf. All
messages between your device and the server are encrypted, and the
server can be managed by professional IT staff in a jurisdiction with
tight privacy laws to increase your safety. Tor routes messages randomly
through a network of servers, making traffic much harder to track. Both
reduce risk, but neither eliminates it if your device is compromised, if
the VPN is subpoenaed, or if you log in to accounts over Tor (thereby
revealing your identity to those sites).</p>
<h2>Use a Password Manager</h2>
<p>Using a weak password is a good way to ensure that your account will
eventually be compromised, in part because <a href="../glossary/#dictionary-attack">dictionary
attacks</a> can be run offline against encrypted
password files to find passwords that match common patterns. Using a
clever password scheme, such as the name of the site plus a word only
you know, does not increase security by much: whatever scheme you have
thought of, attackers have seen before.  And since people are often
identified on multiple sites by the same email address, as soon as one
site where you've used that scheme is compromised, attackers can guess
the scheme and use it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Reusing passwords ensures that damage spreads, so using a different
password for each site helps limit harm if any are
compromised. However, strong passwords are hard to remember and to
type, so always use a <a href="../glossary/#password-manager">password manager</a> that
generates strong passwords and saves them all under a master
<a href="../glossary/#passphrase">passphrase</a>. Your passphrase should be several words
long and something you are unlikely to forget. It does create a single
point of attack, but is still safer than choosing passwords yourself,
since password managers aren't fooled by similar-seeming sites like
paypaI.com.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Writing passwords down and keeping them in your wallet is not
necessarily a bad practice---it depends on who is doing it. For
example, an elderly person who finds tech confusing might well choose
simple, easy-to-guess passwords for their accounts if they have to be
remembered. On the other hand, they have a lifetime of practice
keeping track of bits of paper, and will probably notice if their
purse or wallet is stolen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Use Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication relies on something you <em>know</em> (like a password),
something you <em>have</em> (like a security key), or something you <em>are</em>
(like your fingerprints). <a href="../glossary/#2fa">Two-factor authentication</a> requires
two of these together to establish your identity, e.g., a password
(which can be stolen electronically) plus a random code generated by
an app on your phone (which means attackers need access to you).</p>
<p>2FA is as important to security as using a password manager, but where
possible, you should rely on an app for 2FA instead of using text
messages. What you should <em>never</em> do is share a confirmation code, since
a common attack is to trigger a password reset and then call the victim
pretending to be from the IT department and ask them to read the code
back to "verify" your account. As soon as you do this, the attacker can
change your password and get into your account.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Many security experts now recommend using a physical 2FA key such as a
YubiKey, which fits on a keychain and plugs into a standard USB port.
Sites like <a href="https://techsolidarity.org/">Tech Solidarity</a> have
easy-to-follow instructions explaining how to set them up for a range
of popular social networking sites.</p>
</div>
<h2>Think Before Opening</h2>
<p>Much of the software we use was designed in more innocent times, and
since companies are almost never held liable for the damage caused by
their software, they have consistently prioritized convenience for the
many over harm to the few. One common example is documents that contain
code called "macros" that automatically execute when the document is
opened. Used for good, a macro can check that an address field has been
filled in correctly. Used for evil, it can email everyone in your
address book, or send a copy of those addresses to anyone in the world.
Microsoft Word and Excel are particularly notorious for this
vulnerability, but many other kinds of documents have the same flaw.</p>
<p>Attempts to get you to open an email attachment, click on a link,
install software, or log into a website are called
<a href="../glossary/#phishing">phishing</a> attacks.  The strongest defense is to never do
these things, but in the modern world that would make most work
impossible. The second-best defense is to take sensible
precautions. If you are able, invest in virus scanning software such
as <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection">Proofpoint</a> to scan email attachments before you
download them. While many email clients have virus scanning technology
built-in, this will offer an extra layer of protection.</p>
<p>Similarly, don't click links in emails without checking them first:
instead, hover over the link and see if it matches the site it claims to
be. Alternatively, log into the site manually rather than following the
provided link. It takes more time, but is still faster than fixing your
credit rating. And when you go to a web site, check the real domain name
in the URL: paypaI.com with an upper-case "I" instead of a lower-case
"l" is not the site it pretends to be, and <code>wwwpaypal.com</code> is a
different domain than <code>www.paypal.com</code>.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p>Many sites send an email with a random URL to confirm your identity
when you are resetting your password. On the one hand, this means that
an attacker has to get access to your email in order to break into
your account. On the other hand, random URLs are hard to type in, so
these emails encourage us to click on links in emails. If you are not
expecting a password reset email, <em>don't click on the link</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>While phishing attacks are wide-ranging,
<a href="../glossary/#spearphishing">spearphishing</a> describes the use of data harvested
from previous victims to attack specific targets.  Here, the best
defense is to very suspicious emails, e.g., by phoning people to
confirm their identity. It's particularly important to do this when
you are sent things like password reset instructions. Many IT
departments send out messages that are indistinguishable from
spearphishing attacks, which just trains people to be victims.</p>
<h2>Erase Before Discarding</h2>
<p>Moving files into the trash and then emptying it does not actually erase
the data: it just tells the computer that the space is available for
reuse. (This is why reporters and private investigators regularly go
dumpster diving.) The best way to address this problem is to encrypt
your hard drive, which is a quick setup option for all major operating
systems these days.</p>
<p>Even with that, you should act as if any device you throw away is going
to fall into unfriendly hands. Use a secure deletion tool like BleachBit
(Linux or Windows) or FileShredder (MacOS) before selling, recycling, or
discarding your hardware, but keep in mind that this doesn't affect
backups or files stored online on sites like Dropbox. And keep in mind
that it is practically impossible to truly delete data from social
networking sites: in most cases, their "delete" usually means "don't
show any more" rather than "erase all past record of".</p>
<h2>Check Devices and Accounts Regularly</h2>
<p>Many tech companies who offer free products and services make money by
selling targeted advertising to you using the data they have about you.
They do give users some control over personal data, but they frequently
change their terms of service in opaque ways. Seemingly-innocuous
information can give attackers valuable clues: restaurant "likes" reveal
where you were at specific times, while funny stories about childhood
birthday parties reveal likely answers to security questions. Again,
it's a good practice to get into the habit of checking your privacy
settings every time you do some other regular task.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if you do this, information may leak through other
means. For example, attackers can friend your friends in an attempt to
get information about you, such as the name of your first school. And
as bad as social media sites are for social engineering in this way,
cell phone applications are often worse (not even counting the ones
that turn out to be government-sponsored spyware [<a href="../bibliography/#Schneier2019">Schneier2019</a>].
In general, if a game wants access to your camera and address book,
you should probably find a different game to play.</p>
<p>Since social media is a fact of life for most of us, you should check
your settings periodically, just as you would take your car in for an
oil change. (The authors do these things at the same time in order to
remember both.) Turn off everything you can and then use a tracking
blocker such as Ghostery to reduce information leakage.</p>
<p>Many experts recommend using separate devices or accounts for work and
personal life, but this is increasingly unrealistic. Everyone checks
their personal email from their work device eventually, and everyone
uses their personal phone for 2FA. However, you should consider getting
a second phone for international travel: the legalities around who can
take your devices and/or force you to unlock them are complicated and
frequently overstepped, so you should assume that anything on or
connected to the devices you are traveling with will be compromised.</p>
<div class="callout">
<p><em>Never</em> plug a random USB drive into your device: it's like letting a
complete stranger into your home unsupervised.</p>
</div>
<h2>Fight Back</h2>
<p>Casual attackers may eventually get bored and move on, but like all
bullies, they will also often revisit previous victims, and even if they
don't, they are likely to pick new ones. If you have been attacked:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Find support.</strong> Being targeted is frightening and wearying,
    particularly if you belong to one of the many groups that are
    targeted in real life as well as online. Let family, friends, and
    colleagues know what is happening so that they can support you. They
    may also be able to offer advice if they have been in similar
    situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use anti-harassment apps</strong> like <a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/">Block Party</a> and
    document everything. Save emails and take screenshots of sites
    like Facebook and Twitter (in case attackers delete or alter
    material).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not engage directly.</strong> Casual attackers are often seeking
    attention, so a direct response often encourages further attacks
    (and can draw attention from like-minded attackers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Report the attack.</strong> Social media sites have done everything they
    can to avoid legal accountability for online attacks, but companies
    and universities will usually take what steps they can once they
    know there is a problem. In the authors' experience, they are more
    inclined to take real action against the attacker if they believe
    that you might speak publicly about what has happened and thereby
    damage their reputation, so never agree to a non-disclosure
    agreement that would prevent you from doing so.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>It's Not All About You</h2>
<p>Our final rule brings us full circle to the first one. We don't just
wear masks to prevent ourselves from becoming infected: we also wear
them so that we will not infect others. Similarly, if you do not take
precautions with online security then you are putting others at risk.
Simple steps like putting passwords on PDFs that contain sensitive
information can go a long way to deter attackers, in the same way that a
sturdy-looking bike lock encourages would-be thieves to go after some
other bike. And if you <em>are</em> compromised, let those affected know as
soon as you can.</p>
<p>The only long-term way to improve everyone's online safety is to
pressure politicians to strengthen liability legislation so that
companies, universities, and other institutions have real incentives to
take meaningful action. Cars and drugs are as safe as they are because
their manufacturers are liable for negligence and harm. The sooner
software companies and social media sites are liable as well, the safer
all of us will be.</p>
